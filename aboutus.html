            <h3>SHAPED BY 165 YEARS OF</h3>
            <p>
                LEADERSHIP & INNOVATION The Hail Construction Company of today descends from a small carpentry shop founded in 1855 in Fort Des Moines, Iowa, by Charles H. Hail Construction, an entrepreneurial German immigrant. As the construction company grew, Charles
                Hail Construction handed down his craft, sense of values and quality to his sons, who in turn passed the family business on to their children for four generations. Always an innovator, The Hail Construction Company pioneered the development
                of precast concrete exterior wall construction and became one of the largest producers of architectural precast concrete. During World War II, The Hail Construction Company supported the war effort by constructing ammunition plants in
                record time. Hail Construction emerged as an employee-owned company in March 1995 when 36 stockholders purchased the business debt-free from the Hail Construction family. The number of employee shareholders continued to grow to more than
                300 in the mid-2000s. During that time, The Hail Construction Company grew from a $250 million general contractor to a $1 billion industry leader. In December 2012, Hail Construction was purchased by global engineering and construction
                contractor Orascom Construction PLC, positioning the company for even further growth and construction opportunities both nationally and internationally.
